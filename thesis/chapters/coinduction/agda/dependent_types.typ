=== Type systems<subsection-agda-type_systems>
Agda is both a proof assistant and a programming language. It achieves so by
exploiting interactive programming and a powerful type system, namely a
_dependent_ one. In brief, such a type system allows types to depend on terms;
it is however worth to analyse a bit more the concepts of type systems whole.
