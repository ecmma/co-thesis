	title = {Concrete Semantics: With Isabelle/HOL},
	year = {2014},
	isbn = {3319105418},
	publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
	abstract = {Part I of this book is a practical introduction to working with
	            the Isabelle proof assistant. It teaches you how to write
	            functional programs and inductive definitions and how to prove
	            properties about them in Isabelles structured proof language. Part
	            II is an introduction to the semantics of imperative languages with
	            an emphasis on applications like compilers and program analysers.
	            The distinguishing feature is that all the mathematics has been
	            formalised in Isabelle and much of it is executable. Part I
	            focusses on the details of proofs in Isabelle; Part II can be read
	            even without familiarity with Isabelles proof language, all proofs
	            are described in detail but informally. The book teaches the reader
	            the art of precise logical reasoning and the practical use of a
	            proof assistant as a surgical tool for formal proofs about computer
	            science artefacts. In this sense it represents a formal approach to
	            computer science, not just semantics. The Isabelle formalisation,
	            including the proofs and accompanying slides, are freely available
	            online, and the book is suitable for graduate students, advanced
	            undergraduate students, and researchers in theoretical computer
	            science and logic.},
