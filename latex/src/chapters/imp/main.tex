\chapter{The IMP language}

In this chapter we will go over the implementation of a simple imperative language
called \textbf{Imp}, as described in \cite{logical-foundations}. After defining
its syntax, we will give rules for its semantics and show its implementation in
Agda. After this introductory work, we will discuss analysis and optimization of
Imp programs.
