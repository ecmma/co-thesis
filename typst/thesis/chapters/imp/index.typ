= The Imp programming language <chapter-imp>

In this chapter we will go over the implementation of a simple imperative
language called *Imp*, as described in @logical-foundations. After defining its
syntax, we will give rules for its semantics and show its implementation in
Agda. After this introductory work, we will discuss analysis and optimization of
Imp programs.
